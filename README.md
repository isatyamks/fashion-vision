# 👗 Fashion Vision — See Fashion, Build Futures

*Where style meets pixels, and creativity meets machine learning.*

Fashion Vision is your experimental playground for building AI-powered fashion understanding systems — from classification to visual search.  
It’s designed for builders, students, and researchers who want to turn messy outfit photos into structured, searchable data — fast and beautifully.

## 🌟 Why Fashion Vision Exists

- 🧩 **Structure the chaos**: Turn unorganized fashion images into labeled, searchable datasets.
- ⚡ **Prototype faster**: Get up and running with working ML examples in minutes.
- 🧠 **Learn by doing**: Each script and notebook is self-explanatory and focused on real-world fashion tasks — classification, detection, and recommendation.
- 📈 **Bridge research & product**: Build models that don’t just work in notebooks — but scale to production.

## 🧰 What You’ll Find Inside

- 🧪 **Mini Notebooks**: Run compact, self-contained experiments without setup headaches.
- 🎯 **Plug-and-Play Scripts**: Prebuilt training, evaluation, and inference scripts for image tasks.
- 🧼 **Preprocessing Tools**: Utilities for cleaning and normalizing fashion datasets.
- 📘 **Practical Notes**: Guidance on model choices, metrics, and common pitfalls in fashion AI.

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes or Less)

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isatyamks/fashion-vision.git
   cd fashion-vision
   ```

2. **Setup Your Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt || echo "Install torch, torchvision, pandas manually if needed"
   ```

3. **Run a Demo**  
   Open the notebook below in Jupyter or VS Code:

   `notebooks/demo.ipynb`

   Run the first cell to download a sample dataset and see a pretrained model classify clothing items like T-shirts, jackets, and dresses.

## ✨ What You Can Build

- 🧍‍♀️ **Fashion Classifier**: Train a lightweight model to identify T-shirts, blouses, or jackets.
- 🔍 **Visual Search Engine**: Upload an image — find similar catalog items using embeddings.
- 🎨 **Attribute Extractor**: Detect color, pattern, or sleeve length to enrich metadata.
- 📱 **Deploy Anywhere**: Optimize for mobile and edge inference.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Practical over perfect**: Ship working examples first, polish later.
- **Transparency first**: Every decision is explained with short, clear notes.
- **Reproducibility matters**: Seed everything, log configs, and version datasets.

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to join the runway? Here’s the fast lane:

- ⭐ Star & Fork this repo — it helps more builders discover it.
- 🐛 Open an Issue with a crisp title & short reproduction.
- 🌿 Create a Branch: `feat/<short>` or `fix/<short>`, then submit a Pull Request.

Good starter tasks:

- 🧩 Add an inference script (`inference.py`) for single-image predictions.
- 📦 Create a minimal `requirements.txt` for the notebooks.
