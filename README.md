## About
Fashion Vision is a simple, easy-to-understand repository intended to host experiments, datasets pointers, model code, and notebooks for fashion-focused computer vision projects. It is written to be approachable for contributors and users who are getting started with vision models in fashion.

## Features
- Clean, documented examples for training and evaluating vision models
- Scripts to preprocess common fashion datasets (add your dataset specifics)
- Example notebooks for model prototyping and visualization

(Replace or extend these features to match the actual contents of this repository.)

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isatyamks/fashion-vision.git
cd fashion-vision
```

2. (Recommended) Create and activate a Python virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies (if a requirements file exists)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run a quick script or notebook (example)
```bash
python scripts/train_example.py --config configs/example.yaml
# or open notebooks/example.ipynb
```

## Usage
- Add clear usage examples here for the main scripts, CLI commands, or REST endpoints your project provides.
- If your project uses Docker, add `docker build` and `docker run` examples.

## Development
- Use feature branches named like `feat/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`.
- Run tests with `pytest` (if tests exist).
- Follow code style used across the repo (add linting commands if available).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. A minimal flow:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit changes with clear messages
4. Push and open a Pull Request

If you have a CONTRIBUTING.md, link it here and follow its guidance.
