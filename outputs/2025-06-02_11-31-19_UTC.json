  "transcript": " Hi, my name is Zainika Joggesian, I am a Down syndrome advocate, model and a co-founder of  Homebred by G&Z.  So my journey was like, you know, very like random and like unplanned.  I love to try, you know, explore different styles and you know, work with different people.  I won't lie at all, I have the most amazing feeling to be on such a big international  magazine, The Vogue.  It was like a kind of a different kind of a feeling and it meant a lot to me and my family.  So during the shoot of The Vogue, what I really realized was that I started to love the camera  and I also realized how I love the attention.  I've become so confident in front of the camera now and that's how I got love for modeling.  Yes, I have been truly grateful and blessed that how I perceive Down syndrome, right?  Down syndrome is just a condition that we are born with and it doesn't determine how  your present or your future will be.  I just want everyone to understand that.  So my message is very simple, believe in yourself and then believe in others.  Press positivity, don't bring people down.  If you are in a position of giving opportunities, then not just people with Down syndrome but  with other conditions too, please do."
